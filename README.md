# Ratno
Ratno is a free, open source project and detects file change. This project was abandoned due to high false positive rates but you may be able to use it for learning or you may be able to upgrade it.

Although ratno is abandoned, i still use it on my host machine and it has a place in my heart. something no other project ever has. And this is why i was determined to finish it. But due to my lazyness and the fact the product had nothing but bad reviews. I had to abandon it. :(

Anyways, maybe you can make something out of it. (You'll still be able to download the file from ratno.ml where the latest version will be released. although this version may be packed and obfuscated.)

Thanks, enjoy the project
